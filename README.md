# PDF-Reader
I created this PDF reader as a solution to the growing trend of subscription-based apps that require users to pay recurring fees for basic functionality. My goal was to provide a user-friendly and completely free alternative, allowing people to access and manage their PDF files without worrying about hidden costs or ongoing charges. This project reflects my commitment to offering practical tools that prioritize user convenience and affordability.
